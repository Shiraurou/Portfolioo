        <h1>ABOUT ME!</h1>
        <p>I'ts me, high! I'm the problem it's me! High! My name is James Zyron Frederick L. Arellano! I'm a 21 yrs old BSICT 2nd year student at WVSU Lambunao Chapter who has huge interest in front-end web designing and game developing but lack self discipline and has motivation like a shore that experiencing high and low tides.</p>
        
        <p>
            
           Aside from that, this pitiful human being was a blessed fast-learner and a cursed creature with short term memory loss. Despite that, my imagination and creativity still prevails! atleast in my head. It'll be a blessing if they ever escape out my brain and make it in to one of my works and projects. But! You know what they say, the thought still counts(justifying laziness and irresponsibility so hard rn lol!).
           
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But don't worry! I am a human being like anyone else and we all cannot escape the instinct improve and adapt to experience things better! slowly but surely, I am making my way up there!
        </p>

          Thanks for visiting and I hope you enjoy getting to know a little about me and looking into my unfinished projects and samples(*gulps*). See you Later and have a great day!
